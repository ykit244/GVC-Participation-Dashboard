# GVC Dashboard

An interactive Shiny dashboard for visualizing and analyzing Global Value Chain (GVC) participation patterns in international trade.
🔍 Visit the dashboard here: https://ykit244.shinyapps.io/gvc-dashboard/

## Overview

This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into bilateral trade relationships through the lens of global value chains, enabling researchers and policymakers to understand how countries integrate into international production networks.

## Key Features

### 📊 Overview Tab
- Summary statistics for 76 economies across the manufacturing sector
- Interactive data table with filtering and search capabilities

### 🌍 Network Analysis Tab
- **Geographic Network Map**: Interactive world map visualizing trade relationships with node sizes and connection lines scaled by selected metrics
- **Dual Ranking Charts**: Side-by-side comparison of top trading partners ranked by:
  - GVC Participation (integration depth)
  - Total GVC (absolute trade value)
- Dynamic controls for customizing partner count (5-30) and visualization metrics

## Data Specifications

- **Economies**: 76 countries worldwide
- **Sector**: Manufacturing (OECD 2023 definition)
- **Time Period**: 1995-2020 (26 years)
- **Metrics**: 
  - Forward Linkage (GVCF): Domestic value-added embedded in other countries' exports
  - Backward Linkage (GVCB): Foreign value-added embedded in domestic exports
  - GVC Participation Index: Integration depth into global value chains

## Coming soon
- **Time Series Analysis** tracking GVC participation evolution and structural changes
- **Economic Analysis** examining GDP-GVC correlations through scatter plots.
